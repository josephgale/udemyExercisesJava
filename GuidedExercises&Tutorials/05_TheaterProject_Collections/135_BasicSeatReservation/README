This tutorial has annotations for the following concepts: 
1. Lexographical comparisons
  a. 'A' is less than 'a', '1' is less than 'A', '01' is less than '1'
  
2. The logic behind how the Theatre seat numbers are derived. 
  a. using String.format("%2d", variableChoice)

3. No annotations, but personal review of using inner class in conjunction with addSeat
to use booleans when employing method to addSeat.
